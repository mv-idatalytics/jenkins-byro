Features
========

As byro is under active development, this feature list can become outdated.
Please `open issues`_ for features you are missing!

- **Member management:** Add, and edit members and their data.
- **Membership management:** Add and change the membership fees a member should pay.
- **Add custom member data:** Track non-standard member data by adding a plugin to byro. There are plenty of example plugins and developer documentation to help you.
- **Import payment data:** Inbuilt support for CSV imports.
- **Import and match payment data** to members via custom methods, added by plugins.
- **Send mails:** All mails can be reviewed before they are sent out. You can also edit the default mail templates and add new ones.
- **See member balances**. You can also check every single transaction at any time.
- **Upload member specific documents:** (either for or by them); optionally send them per mail automatically.
- **Let members interact:** Members can choose to make their data (which parts is their decision) visible to other members. Having a look at the member directory helps them interact directly with other members.

Please note that byro is a tool for tracking member data and payments, and the
administrative acts around it. byro does support bookkeeping and transactions,
but it is not a complete bookkeeping tool (yet).
