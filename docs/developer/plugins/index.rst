Plugin Development
------------------

byro will not be usable for you without any plugins. We recommend that you have
a look at our `GitHub organisation`_ to see what kind of plugins are already
available and you can adapt it to your use cases.

byro plugin capabilities should be endless, so if you run into something you'd
like to do with a plugin, and are missing a plugin hook, please `tell us about
it`_, and we'll be happy to add a hook to help you out.

The following pages will discuss plugin workings in general, list the plugin
hooks provided so far, and show how to save member data that is not included by
default, or add a custom payment provider.

If you run into trouble using this documentation, please `tell us about it`_,
too.
