Developer documentation
-----------------------

This part of the byro documentation is for you if you want to improve byro or develop a plugin.

If you want to improve byro itself, please head to our
:doc:`contributor documentation </developer/contributing>`.

If you want to work on byro's code (no matter which part), you'll want to start with the
:doc:`/developer/setup`.
It contains the contributing guidelines, an explanation on how to build a pull request, which
style guidelines to follow, and an internal API documentation.

If you want to develop (or improve) a plugin, have a look at our
:doc:`plugin development guides </developer/plugins/index>`:
They show how to develop a byro plugin with some hopefully easy-to-follow example plugins.

If any part of the documentation is unclear, please head over to the
:doc:`documentation setup </developer/documentation>` to learn how to improve it, and then
follow the :doc:`contributor documentation </developer/contributing>` to create a pull request.
